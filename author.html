                  <h2>Childhood</h2>
                  <p>
                    Born to Manuel Padilla and Cynthia Peters on March 24, 1979,
                    in Apple Valley, California, I grew up poor and fully aware.
                    By the age of four, I could discern the good and bad in
                    people. I sensed their true intentions. I looked to my
                    parents and other adults in my life to understand why people
                    chose good over bad—or bad over good.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I remember observing the good that adults did for others and
                    began building my core beliefs. These core beliefs became
                    the foundation for how I would treat others—and how I would
                    allow them to treat me. To this day, my core values are:
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness,
                    Gentleness, and Self-Control.
                  </h4>
                  <p><em>Galatians 5:22-23</em></p>

                  <h4>From these, I developed my work values of:</h4>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Honesty</li>
                    <li>Kindness</li>
                    <li>Responsibility</li>
                    <li>Fairness</li>
                    <li>Atmosphere</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    I learned that sometimes you have to accept what is and make
                    the best of it. I trust easily and look for the good in
                    people, no matter how small it may be.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    God was in and out of my life depending on who was around me.
                    As a child, adults are responsible for nourishing us—
                    physically, emotionally, and spiritually. As I got older, I
                    felt resentment toward God for not saving me from bad
                    people. But as an adult, I realized just how much He was
                    there for me—I just didn’t know it at the time.

                  <h2>Education and Career</h2>
                  <p>
                    The first in my family to graduate from college, I earned my
                    Cosmetology License on September 17, 1998. I gave birth to
                    my first child on November 26, 1998, and worked various odd
                    jobs from the age of eight through today. I gave birth to my
                    second child on July 20, 2001. I attempted college a second
                    time but had to resign.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After the birth of my third child on April 17, 2003, I
                    started a daycare and also did hair and nails to help pay
                    the bills. I attempted college again but had to resign once
                    more. I focused on raising my kids and helping others with
                    theirs until my children started school. Then I became an
                    avid volunteer, eventually earning an honorary award for the
                    most volunteer hours that school year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once my kids were all over the age of four, I earned my
                    school bus driver’s license and drove school buses in both
                    California and Idaho.

                  <p>
                    After returning home from Idaho, I decided to go back to
                    school for the third time—and this time, I succeeded. I
                    earned a Bachelor of Arts in Social Science with a
                    concentration in Political Government and Science, and a
                    Bachelor of Arts in Sociology. I developed a real interest
                    in Anthropology. My curiosity grew as we learned about local
                    tribes and how Western influences changed their way of life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I’ve always been fascinated by people—how they function both
                    individually and as part of a group. My biggest interest
                    lies in the roles people play in group settings and how each
                    role contributes to the group’s overall harmony. By then, my
                    kids were old enough to volunteer with me in our community.

                    I attempted college again in 2020 and 2021, but had to take
                    a leave of absence both times due to COVID-related
                    challenges and homelessness. I came off of being homeless on
                    January 21, 2022. My vehicle shows more interior wear than
                    it should, but we had survived our third period of
                    homelessness since the pandemic began. I am currently
                    renting a room in hopes of eventually having my own place.

                  <h2>Bitwise Coding Journey</h2>
                  <p>
                    On February 19, 2022, an employee from Bitwise Industries
                    told me about their Workforce Training classes in coding and
                    web design. It seemed too good to be true, but after a
                    one-on-one conversation, I decided to enroll. I had my first
                    introduction to coding on February 23, 2022. Like LEGOs and
                    Minecraft before it, I took to coding within days. I learned
                    quickly and was fortunate to help others who struggled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I successfully completed all four courses:
                    <em>Websites for Beginners</em>, <em>Mobile Friendly</em>,
                    <em>JavaScript for Beginners</em>, and <em>React</em>. The
                    website for my final project for the <em>React</em> course
                    was completed and published.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have recently updated all code and am now waiting for more
                    information from my good friend Richie to add to the final
                    project. I plan to publish this project by the end of 2025.

                  <p>
                    I’ve built this Business Portfolio Website to showcase my
                    skills to potential clients and employers. I plan to update
                    all the code from my past four years of projects and link
                    them to this site. I’ll also include short videos explaining
                    how to use each one. My goal is to build a successful career
                    in web design and development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eventually, I hope to purchase land where I can place a
                    modular home for myself and my grandchild. I know the road
                    ahead won’t be easy—but I’m ready to take one successful
                    step at a time toward our beautiful future!
