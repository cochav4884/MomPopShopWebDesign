                <h2>Childhood</h2>
                <p>
                  Born to Manuel Padilla and Cynthia Peters on March 24, 1979,
                  in Apple Valley, California, I grew up poor and fully aware.
                  By the age of four, I could discern the good and bad in
                  people. I sensed their true intentions. I looked to my parents
                  and other adults in my life to understand why people chose
                  good over bad‚Äîor bad over good.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I remember observing the good that adults did for others and
                  began building my core beliefs. These core beliefs became the
                  foundation for how I would treat others‚Äîand how I would allow
                  them to treat me. To this day, my core values are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Don‚Äôt steal</li>
                  <li>Don‚Äôt cheat</li>
                  <li>Don‚Äôt lie</li>
                  <li>Don‚Äôt hit</li>
                  <li>Don‚Äôt call me dumb</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  I learned that sometimes you have to accept what is and make
                  the best of it. I trust easily and look for the good in
                  people, no matter how small it may be.
                </p>
                <p>
                  God was in and out of my life depending on who was around me.
                  As a child, adults are responsible for nourishing
                  us‚Äîphysically, emotionally, and spiritually. As I got older, I
                  felt resentment toward God for not saving me from bad people.
                  But as an adult, I realized just how much He was there for
                  me‚ÄîI just didn‚Äôt know it at the time.

                <h2>Education and Career</h2>
                <p>
                  The first in my family to graduate from college, I earned my
                  Cosmetology License on September 17, 1998. I gave birth to my
                  first child on November 26, 1998, and worked various odd jobs
                  from the age of eight through today. I gave birth to my second
                  child on July 20, 2001. I attempted college a second time but
                  had to resign.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the birth of my third child on April 17, 2003, I started
                  a daycare and also did hair and nails to help pay the bills. I
                  attempted college again but had to resign once more. I focused
                  on raising my kids and helping others with theirs until my
                  children started school. Then I became an avid volunteer,
                  eventually earning an honorary award for the most volunteer
                  hours that school year. The award was a handmade book from the
                  preschoolers featuring the words they learned to spell that
                  year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once my kids were all over the age of four, I earned my school
                  bus driver‚Äôs license and drove school buses in both California
                  and Idaho.

                <h2>Later Education & Volunteering</h2>
                <p>
                  After returning home from Idaho, I decided to go back to
                  school for the third time‚Äîand this time, I succeeded. I earned
                  a Bachelor of Arts in Social Science with a concentration in
                  Political Government and Science, and a Bachelor of Arts in
                  Sociology. I developed a real interest in Anthropology. My
                  curiosity grew as we learned about local tribes and how
                  Western influences changed their way of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I‚Äôve always been fascinated by people‚Äîhow they function both
                  individually and as part of a group. My biggest interest lies
                  in the roles people play in group settings and how each role
                  contributes to the group‚Äôs overall harmony. By then, my kids
                  were old enough to volunteer with me in our community. Over
                  time, much of what we did together counted as community
                  service hours on their school records.

                <h2>Challenges & Resilience</h2>
                <p>
                  I attempted college again in 2020 and 2021, but had to take a
                  leave of absence both times due to COVID-related challenges
                  and homelessness. I came off of being homeless on January 21,
                  2022. My vehicle shows more interior wear than it should, but
                  we had survived our third period of homelessness since the
                  pandemic began. I am currently renting a room in hopes of
                  eventually having my own place.

                <h2>Bitwise Coding Journey</h2>
                <p>
                  On February 19, 2022, an employee from Bitwise Industries told
                  me about their Workforce Training classes in coding and web
                  design. It seemed too good to be true, but after a one-on-one
                  conversation, I decided to enroll. I had my first introduction
                  to coding on February 23, 2022. Like LEGOs and Minecraft
                  before it, I took to coding within days. I learned quickly and
                  was fortunate to help others who struggled. I‚Äôve been
                  preparing for this moment my whole life‚Äîstrategic board games,
                  mystery books, puzzles, LEGOs, Minecraft‚Äîthey all built the
                  foundation for the best skill I‚Äôve ever learned: coding for
                  web design.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I successfully completed all four courses:
                  <em>Websites for Beginners</em>, <em>Mobile Friendly</em>,
                  <em>JavaScript for Beginners</em>, and <em>React</em>. The
                  website for my final project for the <em>React</em> course was
                  completed and published.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have recently updated all code and am now waiting for more
                  information from my good friend Richie to add to the final
                  project. I want to learn more about where Richie lives, and
                  together we hope all users of the website will learn as much
                  as we did‚Äîand maybe even choose to visit. I plan to publish
                  this project by the end of 2025.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I look forward to continuing to expand my skills and projects
                  as I grow in my coding journey.

                <p>
                  I‚Äôve built this Business Portfolio Website to showcase my
                  skills to potential clients and employers. I plan to update
                  all the code from my past four years of projects and link them
                  to this site. I‚Äôll also include short videos explaining how to
                  use each one. My goal is to build a successful career in web
                  design and development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eventually, I hope to purchase land where I can place a
                  modular home for myself and my grandchild. I know the road
                  ahead won‚Äôt be easy‚Äîbut I‚Äôm ready to take one successful step
                  at a time toward our beautiful future!
